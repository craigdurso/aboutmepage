  <div class="aboutmepage">A graduate from <em>Quinnipiac University in 2012</em> with a bachelor's degree in economics and business management. I began my post undergrad career managing and operating a family business. After realizing that returning to school would be the option for me to expand my career, I pursued a <em>MBA from Adelphi University,</em> before beginning my career with Citi in 2015. Outside of my career, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, sailing, and learning new skills and hobbies. In the future I look to continue my career with Citi and running a project management team.</div>
